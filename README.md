# Libft - A Custom C Library

Libft is a personal C library that reimplements essential standard functions for string manipulation and memory management. It serves as a foundational toolkit for working with C, making low-level programming more convenient and efficient.

## ðŸ”§ What's Inside?

This library includes:

- **Standard Library Functions** - Rewritten versions of common C functions like strlen, memcpy, strdup, and more.
- **Additional Utilities** - Useful functions like ft_substr, ft_strjoin, and ft_split to handle strings and memory more effectively.

## âš¡ How It Works

Libft is compiled into a static library (libft.a), which can be linked to any C project. Once compiled, it can be included just like any standard library, providing a reliable set of tools for handling fundamental programming tasks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why It Matters

Writing these functions from scratch deepens the understanding of how C works under the hood, reinforcing key programming concepts like memory allocation and pointer manipulation.
